### Notes for Self - Security Assessment Report

#### Findings and Recommendations

**Website 1: 10.3.21.141:8000**

- **Angular Template Injection**:
  - **Issue**: Attackers can run JavaScript code in users' browsers.
  - **Recommendation**: Sanitize inputs, update Angular, use output encoding, and implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
  - **Issue**: Malicious scripts can be injected and run on the site.
  - **Recommendation**: Improve input validation, sanitize inputs, and use CSP.

**Website 2: 10.3.21.141:8008**

- **Client-State Manipulation**:
  - **Issue**: Users can change data sent back to the server to gain unauthorized access.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement server-side checks, secure session management, and validate parameters.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
  - **Issue**: Attackers can trick users into performing unwanted actions.
  - **Recommendation**: Use CSRF tokens, limit cookie usage to the same origin, and implement referrer policies.

**Website 3: www.hackthissite.org**

- **Level 1: Hardcoded Passwords**:
  - **Issue**: Passwords are stored directly in the code.
  - **Recommendation**: Store passwords securely, use access controls, encrypt passwords, and conduct regular security checks.

- **Level 2: Bypass Password Protection**:
  - **Issue**: Users can bypass login by submitting empty forms.
  - **Recommendation**: Ensure all files are present, show clear error messages, verify on the server, and secure login forms.

- **Level 3: Directory Traversal**:
  - **Issue**: Users can access files outside intended directories.
  - **Recommendation**: Validate inputs, limit file access, check inputs on the server, and use security headers.

- **Level 4: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**:
  - **Issue**: Users can access unauthorized internal objects.
  - **Recommendation**: Hide internal references, control access, monitor for misuse, and limit user actions.

- **Level 5: DOM Manipulation**:
  - **Issue**: Users can manipulate the DOM directly.
  - **Recommendation**: Validate user inputs, use CSP, check messages, and educate users on security.

- **Level 6: Weak Encryption**:
  - **Issue**: Encryption is weak and easily broken.
  - **Recommendation**: Use strong encryption, protect keys, choose trusted tools, and stay updated on security.

- **Level 7: Command Injection**:
  - **Issue**: Users can run commands on the host system.
  - **Recommendation**: Monitor inputs, use safe commands, write secure code, and separate privileges.

- **Level 8: Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection**:
  - **Issue**: Users can inject commands via SSI.
  - **Recommendation**: Validate user inputs, set server rules, and check everything before use.

- **Level 9: SSI Injection (Repeated)**:
  - **Issue**: Same as Level 8.
  - **Recommendation**: Same as Level 8.

- **Level 10: Insecure Cookie Handling**:
  - **Issue**: Cookies can be manipulated to gain unauthorized access.
  - **Recommendation**: Use strong cookies, keep sessions secure, encrypt data, and check for problems regularly.

#### Conclusion
By addressing these vulnerabilities, we can greatly enhance the security of the web applications, protect user data, and prevent unauthorized access.
