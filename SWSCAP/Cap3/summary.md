## Authentication Vulnerabilities

### Username Enumeration

**Vulnerability:** Revealing valid usernames through different error messages.  
**Solution:** Implement generic error messages to avoid disclosing valid usernames. Use mechanisms like rate limiting, account lockout, CAPTCHA, and monitoring of failed login attempts.

### 2FA Simple Bypass

**Vulnerability:** Bypassing two-factor authentication (2FA) by manipulating URL parameters.  
**Solution:** Ensure 2FA completion before granting access to sensitive pages. Prevent direct URL access to protected resources without proper 2FA. Use time-limited tokens and log all access attempts for monitoring.

### Password Reset Broken Logic

**Vulnerability:** Exploiting weaknesses in password reset functionality to reset other users' passwords.  
**Solution:** Link password reset tokens to specific user requests. Verify username/token correspondence, log reset requests, use CAPTCHA, and monitor for unusual activities.

### Username Enumeration via Subtly Different Responses

**Vulnerability:** Identifying valid usernames and passwords through detailed error responses.  
**Solution:** Standardize error messages to prevent revealing valid usernames. Implement rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and comprehensive logging and monitoring of login attempts.

## API Testing Vulnerabilities

### Exploiting an API Endpoint Using Documentation

**Vulnerability:** Unauthorized access and actions through exposed API documentation.  
**Solution:** Secure API documentation with authentication. Enforce strict access controls, validate and sanitize input, avoid exposing sensitive actions without proper authentication, and monitor API access.

### Finding and Exploiting an Unused API Endpoint

**Vulnerability:** Exploiting insecure API endpoints by manipulating HTTP methods.  
**Solution:** Restrict access to authorized users, validate input data, prevent unauthorized HTTP methods like PATCH, DELETE, or PUT, and ensure secure responses for all requests.

## Access Control Vulnerabilities

### Unprotected Admin Functionality

**Vulnerability:** Exposing sensitive admin paths through public files like robots.txt.  
**Solution:** Use authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict admin panel access. Avoid exposing sensitive directories, implement strong access controls, conduct regular security checks, and use non-obvious paths for sensitive functionalities.

### Unprotected Admin Functionality with Unpredictable URL

**Vulnerability:** Exposing admin functionalities through client-side code.  
**Solution:** Secure admin panels with proper authentication, process sensitive information server-side, avoid exposing admin URLs in client-side scripts, and regularly audit source code for security vulnerabilities.

### User Role Controlled by Request Parameter

**Vulnerability:** Escalating user privileges by manipulating cookie values.  
**Solution:** Ensure secure and non-forgeable cookies, validate user roles server-side, implement robust authentication methods, regenerate session IDs, and conduct regular security audits.

## Business Logic Vulnerabilities

### Excessive Trust in Client-Side Controls

**Vulnerability:** Manipulating client-side parameters to bypass pricing logic.  
**Solution:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs server-side, implement secure session management, enforce strict validation during purchases, and monitor application logs for suspicious activities.

### High-Level Logic Vulnerability

**Vulnerability:** Manipulating quantity parameters to alter transaction prices.  
**Solution:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization of user inputs, validate total price calculations server-side, secure session handling, educate developers on secure coding practices, and conduct regular security testing.

### Inconsistent Security Controls

**Vulnerability:** Gaining unauthorized administrative privileges by exploiting registration loopholes.  
**Solution:** Validate email domains during registration, require email verification, restrict administrative functionalities to authorized personnel, educate users on secure practices, and perform regular security audits.
